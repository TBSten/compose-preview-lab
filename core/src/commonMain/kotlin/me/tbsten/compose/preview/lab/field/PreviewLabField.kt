/**
 * Field class specified in PreviewLabScope.field/fieldValue.
 * In reality, it may be better to use the value property, getValue method, and setValue method to implement MutableState.
 *
 * In many cases, it is sufficient to use StringField, SelectableField, etc., and it is unlikely that this class will be set directly.
 * You would use this Composable if you want to create a Field of a custom type (set the value type parameter to your custom type) or if you want to create a UI for a custom Field (override the View method).
 *
 * @property label The label for this field. This is not used in any of the program logic, but only for display purposes, so it is best to set it in a language that is easy for your team members to read.
 * @property initialValue Default value for this field.
 * @property value Current value of this PreviewLabField.

    /**
     * Composable, which displays the entire UI for this Field.
     * If you want to customize the UI, you can override this method in your PreviewLabField to customize the UI.
     * However, in many cases where the UI is customized, overriding the content method is more appropriate.
     *
     * Within the View method, you are responsible for determining whether to display the following
     * - Display label header
     * - The main UI of this Field (i.e., Content method)
     *
     * In many cases, a header that displays the label is required. This means that it is tedious to override it every time.
     * The Content method is preferred over the View method in many cases where the UI is customized because it allows the View to remain the same and only the main UI below the label to be customized.
     *
     * If you are interested in customizing the PreviewLabField UI, please also see the [Customizing Field UI]() documentation.
